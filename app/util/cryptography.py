    This is a bit of a tricky situation: when configured to use encrypted IDs, the entire application should refuse
    to respond to valid decrypted IDs, and should only consider valid (e.g., decryptable) encrypted IDs. However,
    when the application is configured to use decrypted IDs, it should not throw exceptions when attempting to get
    the decrypted ID of an ID that is already decrypted. Similarly, the application should throw exceptions when
    configured to expect only decrypted IDs, but encounters a (potentially valid) encrypted ID.
    The compromise solution here is to throw exceptions depending on the application's current configuration setting.
